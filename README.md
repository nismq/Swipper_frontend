# Swipper frontend

This is the frontend for an international collaboration project between Oulu University of Applied Sciences (Oamk) and Fontys University of Applied Sciences. 
Project idea was to provide a platform where users can add their own animal or search already listed animals.
The frontend was designed and created by a team of five Oamk students listed below.

Match page is additional way to search listed animals. User can like animal by swiping right or by clicking the like button. 
When card is swiped to left, card goes under the deck and will appear again if deck is finished.
